# 2. Analysis

## 2.1 Summary

What is relevant for this US is the relation between *Family* and *Person*. The Family will be composed by **1
administrator** and **0, 1 or multiple non-administrators**. Both administrator and non-administrator are Persons.

Each Person will have two types of attributes. The attributes *name*, *CCNumber*, *birthDate*, *address* and *vatNumber*
will have a **single value** but *EmailAddress* and *PhoneNumber* will behave differently. Both *EmailAddress* and *
PhoneNumber* are attributes that a Person can have more than one. A *Person* **must have at least one email**, but it's
possible that has **none or multiple** *PhoneNumbers*.

The **Person** must have the following characteristics with the following rules:

| **_Value Objects_**         | **_Business Rules_**                                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                    | Required, string                                                                       |
| **BirthDate**               | Required, date(year-month-day)                                                         |
| **Address**                 | Required, string                                                                       |
| **VatNumber**               | Required, unique, Vat must have 9 numeric digits                                       |
| **EmailAddress**            | Required, unique, Email must follow a pattern                                          |
| **PhoneNumber**             | Non-Required, PhoneNumber must have 9 digits                                           |

The **Family** must have the following characteristics with the following rules:

| **_Value Objects_**         | **_Business Rules_**                                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                | Required, string                                                                           |
| **RegistrationDate**    | Required, date(year-month-day)                                                             |

## 2.2. Domain Model Excerpt

The following Domain Model is only referring to this user story. The complete model can be found in the diagrams folder.

```plantuml
@startuml
header Domain Model

skinparam linetype ortho

class Family {
 - Name
 - Registration Date
}

class Person {
 - Name
 - Vat number
 - Birthdate
 - Address
 }

class EmailAddress {

}

class PhoneNumber {

}

Family "1" -> "0..*" Person: has non-administrator members
Family "1" -> "1" Person: has admin 
Person "1" --> "1..*" EmailAddress: has
Person "1 " --> "0..*" PhoneNumber: has

@enduml
```

# 3. Design

The process to fulfill this requirement requires the actor to select the option to create a new family, which would
prompt the input of the name for that family as well as the administrator email, and the other necessary data stated in
2.1.  
Given the current absence of a UI layer the required data will be passed directly into the CreateFamilyController.

## 3.2. Functionality Use

The CreateFamilyController creates a new CreateFamilyService object using a inputFamilyDTO, a inputPersonDTO and the
application.
The CreateFamilyService will create all the necessary value objects to create the family and administrator.
The CreateFamilyService will invoke the Application to retrieve the PersonRepository and FamilyRepository.
The CreateFamilyService will invoke the FamilyRepository to create a familyID and then a Family.
The CreateFamilyService will invoke the PersonRepository to create the Person object for the administrator,
providing the email from the admin is unique. If it isn't, the previously created Family will be deleted.
The CreateFamilyController will then return a true or false response depending on the sucess or insuccess
of creating the Family and administrator.

## 3.3. Applied Patterns

We applied the principles of Controller, Information Expert, Creator and PureFabrication from the GRASP pattern. We also
used the SOLID Single Responsibility Principle.

## 3.4. Tests

Several cases where analyzed in order to test the creation of a new Family

**Test 1:** Test that it is possible to create a new instance of Family with a valid Admin

**Test 2:** Test that it is not possible to create a new instance of Family if admin email is already registered

**Test 3:** Test that it is not possible to create a new instance of Family receiving a **familyName** that is null

**Test 4:** Test that it is not possible to create a new instance of Family receiving a **familyName** that is empty

**Test 5:** Test that it is not possible to create a new instance of Family receiving a **familyName** that is blank

**Additional Tests** Test that its not possible to create a new instance of Family if any attribure is empty, blank or
null The whole user story was tested for the case of success and for failure

**Test 5:** Success

```` 
@DisplayName("Test if a family can be successfully created")  
@Test
 void shouldBeTrueCreateFamily() {
        Application application = new Application();
        Create Family Controller controller = new Create Family Controller(application);
        CreateFamilyDTO inputFamilyDTO = new CreateFamilyDTO("tonyze@hotmail.com", "Silva", "Tony", "12/12/1990", 999999999, 919999999, "Rua das Flores", "Porto", 69, "4400-000", "139861572ZW2");
        
        assertTrue(controller.createFamilyAndAdmin(inputFamilyDTO));    
    }
````

**Test 6:** Failure

````
@DisplayName ("Test if a family isnt created if the admin email is already registered in the app")  
@Test
    void shouldBeFalseCreateFamilyEmailAlreadyregistered() {
        Application application = new Application();
        Create Family Controller controller = new Create Family Controller(application);
        CreateFamilyDTO createFamilyDTO1 = new CreateFamilyDTO("tonyze@hotmail.com", "Silva", "Tony", "12/12/1990", 999999999, 919999999, "Rua das Flores", "Porto", 69, "4400-000", "139861572ZW2");
        CreateFamilyDTO inputFamilyDTO2 = new CreateFamilyDTO("tonyze@hotmail.com", "Pereira", "Rita", "12/12/1990", 999999999, 919999999, "Rua das Flores", "Porto", 69, "4400-000", "139861572ZW2");
        controller.createFamilyAndAdmin(createFamilyDTO1);
        assertFalse(controller.createFamilyAndAdmin(inputFamilyDTO2));    
    }
    }
````

# 4. Implementation

1. All the Value Objects are initially instanced (instantiated), with respective validations.


      public boolean createFamilyAndAddAdmin() {
      boolean result;
      EmailAddress adminEmail = new EmailAddress(inputPersonDTO.unpackEmail());
      FamilyName familyName = new FamilyName(inputFamilyDTO.unpackFamilyName());
      Name name = new Name(inputPersonDTO.unpackName());
      BirthDate birthdate = new BirthDate(inputPersonDTO.unpackBirthDate());
      VATNumber vat = new VATNumber(inputPersonDTO.unpackVAT());
      PhoneNumber phone = new PhoneNumber(inputPersonDTO.unpackPhone());
      Address address = new Address(inputPersonDTO.unpackStreet(), inputPersonDTO.unpackCity(), inputPersonDTO.unpackZipCode(), inputPersonDTO.unpackHouseNumber());
      CCnumber cc = new CCnumber(inputPersonDTO.unpackCCNumber());
      RegistrationDate registrationDate = new RegistrationDate(inputFamilyDTO.unpackLocalDate());

2. Family ID is automatically generated by the Family Repository (Information Expert)


      public FamilyID generateAndGetFamilyID() {
      FamilyID familyID = new FamilyID(UUID.randomUUID());
      if (checkIfFamilyIDExists(familyID)) {
      familyID = generateAndGetFamilyID();
      }
      return familyID;
      }

3. AdminEmail is added to the Family upon its instantiation. The Family is immediately added to the FamilyRepository (
   The administrator email validation will come later.)


      public void createAndAddFamily(FamilyName familyName, FamilyID familyID, RegistrationDate registrationDate, EmailAddress adminEmail) {
      Family family = new Family(familyID, familyName, registrationDate, adminEmail);
      this.families.add(family);
      }

4. Before creating the Administrator, the email is validated in the Person Repository in order to guarantee that it is
   Unique


      private boolean isEmailAlreadyRegistered(EmailAddress email) {
      boolean emailIsRegistered = false;
      for (Person person : people) {
      if (person.isSameEmail(email)) {
      emailIsRegistered = true;
      }
      }
      return emailIsRegistered;
      }

5. If the Email fails verification, the Family is removed from the FamilyRepository and the process fails.

   
      try {
      personRepository.createAndAddPerson(name, birthdate, adminEmail, vat, phone, address, cc, familyID);
      result = true;
      } catch (EmailAlreadyRegisteredException e) {
      familyRepository.removeFamily(familyID);
      result = false;
      }
      return result;


# 5. Integration

The development of this user story was the basis for the family structure where the FamilyMembers are stored and was
thus crucial for the development of the other User Stories

# 6. Observations

As with the Standard Category the family ID will probably need to be reworked in a future sprint to allow for more
complex ID information if needed (probably using a UUID)
