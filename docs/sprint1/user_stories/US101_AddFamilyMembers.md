# US101 Add FamilyMember to a Family
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

### 1.1 Client's Sheet

- As a family Administrator, I want to add a familyMember to a family.

We interpreted this requirement as the function of a familyAdmin to add a new Person to his family. This Person's email account must not exist in the Application neither the vatNumber/citizenCard on any familyMember.

- A familyMember needs to have:
    - ID (unique and generated by the Application);
    - Name;
    - VatNumber;
    - Address;
    - BirthDate;
    - Phone (none or multiple);
    - Email (none or multiple).

### 1.3 Dependencies

This user story has a dependency with these **2** user stories:
- **[US010](US010_AddFamily.md)** *(As a system manager, I want to create a family)*
    - In order to be added a family member, the system needs to have a family;
    
- **[US011](US010_AddFamilyAdministrator.md)** *(As a system manager, I want to add a family administrator)*
   - In order to be added a family member, the family needs to have a family administrator;
   
# 2. Analysis

In order to fulfill this requirement, we need two main data pieces:
- Family ID of the actor's profile
- All the data required to create a new Person (name, dateBirth, vat, phone, address)

At a later iteration, the family member's ID would be aquired through the Log In information. For this sprint, the ID will have to be inputed along with the Person's info.

## 3.1. Functionality Use
The AddFamilyMemberController will invoke the Application object, which stores the Family object.
The App will return the FamilyID from the FamilyAdmin and will invoke the addFamilyMember method. First, there will be an email validation inside the Application to ensure that is unique, then the same will be done to the vatNumber inside the Family object because we are assuming that the same Person can be part of different Families. If any of those validations turn to be true the method fails, otherwise the method is executed by calling the FamilyMember constructor, creating a new Person and storing it inside the Family object. 
To finish this process, the Application return a confirmation message to the controller that will inform the UI, and therefore the user, that the method succeeded. 



## 3.2. Class Diagram
The main Classes involved are:
- AddFamilyMemberController
- Application
- FamilyService

## 3.3. Applied Patterns
We applied the principles of Controller, Information Expert, Creator e PureFabrication from the GRASP pattern.
We also used the SOLID SRP principle.

# 4. Implementation

During this feature implementation extra code was added to avoid the UI limitation. These scenarios were the following:

- ####Verify if the user is a FamilyAdmin

With the UI and login layer implemented, this info is already defined and the controller doesn't need to ask the Family his selfCCNumber to assure the user is Admin.

- ####Get the FamilyID 

With the UI and login layer implemented, it is not necessary to ask which family this user belongs to.

# 5. Integration/Demonstration

As it was said before, this UserStory dependes on both **[US010 - Add Family]** and **[US011 - Add Family Administrator]**.

# 6. Observations

In the future, both issues presented in implementation section will be solved when the UI, and login layer are set up.
With the login layer, the user ID will be already available before the UserStory gets executed, avoiding the method *getFamily(familyID)* execution. 
A similar scenario will happen with *selfCCNumber*, because the UI will already know which user is executing this UserStory and therefore don't need confirm if he has permissions to do it.
