# US150 Get Family Member Profile Information
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

## 1.1. Client Notes

*As a family member, I want to get my profileâ€™s information*

**Demo1** As a family member, I want to get...

- 1.1. My family member profile information

We interpreted this requirement as the function of a user to receive their personal profile information.

- A MemberProfile needs to have the following information:
    - Name;
    - Birth Date;
    - Phone Number(none or multiple);
    - Email (none or multiple);
    - VAT Number;
    - Address;
    - Relation with Administrator(none or one);
    - If member is administrator.

    activate system
    fm -> system: input required data
    system --> fm: return Profile
    deactivate fm
    deactivate system

## 1.3. Dependencies from other User Stories

This user story is dependent on the following:

- US010_Add Family: to create a family;
- US101_Add Family Member: to create and add family member to created family.

# 2. Analysis

In order to fulfill this requirement, we need two main data pieces:
- Family ID of the actor's family
- Family Member ID of the actor's profile

At a later iteration, both the family ID and the family member's ID would be acquired through the Log In information. For this sprint, the IDs will have to be inputted.

This User Story is highly reliant on both the Family and FamilyMember classes, particularly the last one. A DTO approach was chosen to encapsulate the required information, as well as to provide more control over which member information is transmitted.



# 3. Design

The main process to fulfill this requirement would require the actor to select they want to add an email in the UI, which would then prompt the retrieval of their familyMemberID and familyID. In lieu of not having an UI, the Int *familyMemberID* and *familyID* will be directly inputed into the GetFamilyMemberProfileController.

## 3.1. Functionality Use
This User Story's purpose is to allow the retrieval of a member's profile, by the member. The GetFamilyMemberProfileController will invoke the Application object, which stores the FamilyService object. The Application will return the FamilyService to the Controller, and the getMemberProfile method is called to retrieve the Profile as a MemberProfileDTO object, using the familyID and familyMemberID. The Family is retrieve in the FamilyService instantiation and Family Member is then retrieved from the corresponding family.
The Family Member the uses the method createProfile to generate a new object of the type MemberProfileDTO, which is then returned to the FamilyService and then to the Controller.



## 3.2. Class Diagram
The main Classes involved are:
- GetFamilyMemberProfileController
- Application
- FamilyService
- Family
- FamilyMember
- MemberProfileDTO
- CCNumber

**GetProfileInfo()**
```puml
@startuml

title GetProfileInfo()

class GetFamilyMemberProfileController {
  - Application app
  + getMemberProfile()
}

class Application {
  - FamilyService familyService
  + getFamilyService()
}

class FamilyService {
  - List<Family> families
  + getFamily()
  + getFamilyMemberProfile()
}

class Family {
  - int familyID
  - List<FamilyMember> familyMembers
  - getFamilyMemberByID()
  + getFamilyMemberProfile()
  
}

class FamilyMember {
  - CCNumber ccNumber;
  - String name;
  - Date birthDate;
  - List<PhoneNumber> phoneNumbers
  - List<EmailAddress> emails
  - VatNumber vatNumber;
  - Address address;
  - Relation relation;
  - boolean administrator;
  # compareID()
  + createProfile()
  
}

class CCNumber {
  - String ccNumber
  + getCcNumber()
  
}

class MemberProfileDTO {
  - String name

## 3.3. Applied Patterns
We applied the principles of Controller, Information Expert, Creator and PureFabrication from the GRASP pattern.
We also used the SOLID SRP principle.

## 3.4. Tests 

The tests were conducted on FamilyMemberTest, FamilyServiceTest and GetFamilyMemberProfileControllerTest. 
The following preparation was made for the execution of the tests:

    //Family Member Diogo
    String cc = "000000000ZZ4";
    String name = "Diogo";
    Date date = new Date(1990,8,26);
    Integer numero = 919999999;
    String email = "josediogoccbr@gmail.com";
    int nif = 212122233;
    String rua = "Rua Nossa";
    String codPostal = "4444-555";
    String local = "Zinde";
    String city = "Porto";
    String relacao = "filho";
    Relation relation = new Relation(relacao);
    boolean admin = false;

    Address address = new Address(rua, codPostal, local, city);
    EmailAddress emailAddress = new EmailAddress(email);
    List<EmailAddress> emails = new ArrayList<>();
    PhoneNumber phoneNumber = new PhoneNumber(numero);
    List<PhoneNumber> phoneNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
    VatNumber vatNumber = new VatNumber(nif);

    //Family Member Tony

        assertNotEquals(expected, result);
    }


# 4. Implementation

**Finding the correct FamilyMember**

In order to find the relevant Family by its ID, a method was constructed to retrieve the family object

    public Family getFamily(int familyID) {
        if (checkIfFamilyExists(familyID)) {
            for (Family family : families) {
                if (family.getFamilyID() == familyID)
                    return family;
            }
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("No family with such ID");
        }
        return null;
    }

Following that, we can use it to retrieve the correct FamilyMember object:

    private FamilyMember getFamilyMemberByID(String ccNumber) {
        for (FamilyMember familyMember : familyMembers) {
            if (familyMember.compareID(ccNumber))
                return familyMember;
        }
        // If given ID is not present, a exception is thrown
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No family member with such ID");
    }

    protected boolean compareID(String ccNumber) {
        return ccNumber.equals(this.ccNumber.getCcNumber());
    }


**Creating the Family Member Profile**

The Family Member Class triggers the creation of the Family Member Profile with two possible variations based on if the family member has a relation attribute or not:

    public MemberProfileDTO createProfile() {
        if (this.relation == null) {
            return new MemberProfileDTO(name, birthDate, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, administrator);
        }
        return new MemberProfileDTO(name, birthDate, phoneNumbers, emails, vatNumber, address, relation, administrator);
    }


# 5. Integration/Demonstration

As of this sprint, this function has no integration with other functions.

# 6. Observations

In the future, the ccNumber would ideally have to be retrieved by a method that checks the log in info of the current user, instead of the ID being manually inputted. The same applies to the FamilyID.
An approach to have the controller as a boolean while accounting for the possible exceptions, e.g. not finding the Family or Family Member, but was discarded de to issues regarding having 2 exceptions.
